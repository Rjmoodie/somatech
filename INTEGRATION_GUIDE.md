### Data Source Categories
1. **MLS & Listing Sites** (Regional MLS systems)
2. **County Assessors** (Property tax and assessment data)
3. **Tax Delinquent Properties** (Properties with unpaid taxes)
4. **Foreclosures** (Pre-foreclosure and foreclosure data)
5. **Code Violations** (Properties with building code violations)
6. **Probate Properties** (Estate sales and probate listings)
7. **Auctions** (Government and private property auctions)
8. **REO Properties** (Bank-owned properties)
9. **Environmental Data** (Superfund sites, brownfields, etc.)
10. **Demographics** (Census data, population statistics)
11. **Economic Data** (Employment, income, market indicators)
12. **Schools** (School district information)
13. **Crime Data** (Crime statistics and safety information)
14. **Transportation** (Public transit, highways, airports)
15. **Utilities** (Energy, water, internet infrastructure)
16. **Zoning & Permits** (Land use and development permits)
17. **Natural Disasters** (Flood zones, earthquake data)
18. **Healthcare** (Hospitals, medical facilities)
19. **Commercial Properties** (Shopping centers, office buildings, industrial)
20. **Infrastructure** (Data centers, cell towers, renewable energy)

### Implementation Phases

#### IMMEDIATE (Ready to Use)
- County assessor data from major counties
- Tax delinquent properties from high-value counties
- Government auction sites
- Basic environmental and demographic data

#### PHASE_2 (Medium Priority)
- Regional MLS systems
- Additional county data sources
- Enhanced environmental and economic data
- Zoning and permit information

#### PHASE_3 (Advanced Features)
- Premium data sources
- Commercial property directories
- Infrastructure and utility data
- Specialized industry data

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Scraping Session
```typescript
// In the dashboard, you can:
// 1. Click "Start IMMEDIATE Scraping" to begin with high-priority sources
// 2. Use category filters to focus on specific data types
// 3. Monitor progress in real-time
```

### Programmatic Access
```typescript
import { ExpandedDataScraper, expandedDataSources } from '@/components/somatech';

// Initialize the scraper
const scraper = new ExpandedDataScraper();

// Scrape by phase
const immediateResults = await scraper.scrapeByPhase('IMMEDIATE');

// Scrape by category
const taxDelinquentResults = await scraper.scrapeByCategory('Tax Delinquent');

// Scrape individual source
const result = await scraper.scrapeSource('assessor-san-diego');
```

## Configuration Options

### Scraping Configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable delays between requests
- **Error Handling**: Exponential backoff and source skipping
- **Data Validation**: Rules-based validation and confidence scoring
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of scraping results

### Dashboard Settings
- **Auto-refresh**: Enable/disable automatic data updates
- **Error Display**: Show/hide error details
- **Filtering**: Customize which sources to display
- **Statistics**: Configure which metrics to track

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Database Integration
- Compatible with existing Supabase setup
- Uses established data models and schemas
- Integrates with existing property lead system

### UI Integration
- Follows existing design patterns and components
- Uses Shadcn UI components for consistency
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Authentication
- Respects existing user authentication
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Secure API key management

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test the Dashboard**: Navigate to the new module and explore the interface
2. **Start with IMMEDIATE Sources**: Begin scraping high-priority data sources
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch the real-time statistics and success rates

### Future Enhancements
1. **Custom Data Sources**: Add your own specific data sources
2. **Advanced Filtering**: Implement more sophisticated search and filter options
3. **Data Export**: Add functionality to export scraped data
4. **API Integration**: Create REST endpoints for external access
5. **Machine Learning**: Implement predictive analytics on scraped data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Rate Limiting**: If sources are being blocked, increase delays in configuration
2. **Authentication**: Ensure API keys are properly configured for premium sources
3. **Data Quality**: Use the validation features to filter low-quality data
4. **Performance**: Monitor resource usage during large scraping operations

### Support
- Check the `EXPANDED_DATA_SOURCES_GUIDE.md` for detailed technical documentation
- Review the implementation files for specific configuration options
- Use the dashboard's error reporting to identify and resolve issues

## Performance Considerations

### Resource Usage
- **Memory**: Large scraping operations may require significant memory
- **Network**: Monitor bandwidth usage during scraping
- **CPU**: Scraping operations are CPU-intensive

### Optimization Tips
- Use phased implementation to spread load
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor and adjust rate limiting as needed
- Use the dashboard to track performance metrics

## Security & Compliance

### Data Privacy
- All scraping follows robots.txt and terms of service
- Rate limiting prevents server overload
- Error handling prevents accidental data exposure

### Legal Compliance
- Respects website terms of service
- Implements proper attribution for data sources
- Follows data usage guidelines and restrictions

---

This integration provides you with a powerful, scalable system for accessing comprehensive real estate data from 100+ sources across all major categories. The dashboard gives you real-time visibility and control over the data collection process, while the phased implementation allows for gradual rollout and optimization.
