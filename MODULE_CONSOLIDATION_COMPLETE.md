- ❌ **`real-estate`** - Removed (functionality consolidated)
- ❌ **`real-estate-deal-sourcing`** - Removed (functionality consolidated)
- ❌ **Multiple data scraping modules** - Removed (now background services)

### **2. Consolidated into Single Module**
- ✅ **`lead-gen`** → **"Real Estate Leads"** - Single, powerful interface
- ✅ **50-State Data Integration** - Now powers the lead generation behind the scenes
- ✅ **All search functionality** - Unified in one place

// Integrates with 50-state data behind the scenes
const results = await leadGenerationService.searchProperties(filters);
```

### **Enhanced Search:**
```typescript
// Automatically converts user search to 50-state filters
const filters: LeadGenerationFilters = {
  county: "Los Angeles County",
  status: ['tax-delinquent', 'pre-foreclosure'],
  equityRange: { min: 50, max: 100 }
};
```
