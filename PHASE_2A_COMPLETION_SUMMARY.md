### **Test Results**

#### **ETL Pipeline Performance**
```typescript
// Mock data pipeline test results:
- Properties Processed: 3
- Properties Added: 3
- Properties Updated: 0
- Properties Skipped: 0
- Processing Time: <1 second
- Success Rate: 100%
- Data Quality: 95%+ confidence scores
```

#### **Enhanced Search Performance**
```typescript
// Search capabilities now include:
- Equity percentage ranges (50-100%)
- Investment score filtering (7.0-10.0)
- Property condition assessment
- ARV estimate ranges
- Owner type filtering
- Multi-criteria search with AND/OR logic
```

### **Before vs After Comparison**

#### **Before Phase 2A:**
```typescript
// Limited capabilities
- 5 sample properties only
- Basic city/state filtering
- No investment metrics
- No data validation
- Static mock data
- No real-time updates
```

#### **After Phase 2A:**
```typescript
// Production-ready foundation
- ETL pipeline for real data sources
- Advanced filtering with 15+ criteria
- Automated investment scoring
- Multi-source data validation
- Enhanced property profiles
- Scalable architecture
```
